### General Terminology

##### Market Risk :
`Market Risk is the risk of looses in position arising from the movements in market variables like price and volatility.`

##### Notional Value :
`The notational value of derivative instrument is equal to the numner of units undrlying the instrument multiplied by the current market value of each unit of underlying.`

##### Trading Desk :
`A group of traders or trading accounts of a business line within a bank that follow defined trading strategies with goal of generating revenues or maintaining market presence from assuming or managing risk.`

##### Pricing Model :
`A model that is used to determine the value of instrument(mark to market or mark to model) as a functon of pricing parameters or to determine the change in the value of an instrument as a function of risk factors.`


---
### Terminology for Financial Instrument

##### Financial Instrument :
`Any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial iability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments indude primary financial instruments (or cash instruments) and derivative financial instruments.`

##### Instrument :
`The term used to describe financial instruments, instruments on foreign exciange (FX) and commodities.`

##### Embedded derivative: 
`A component of a financial instrument that includes a non-derivative host contract. For example, the conversion option in a convertible bond is an embedded derivative.`

##### Look-through approach: 
`An approach in which a bank determines the relevant capital requirements for a position that has underlyings (such as an index instrument multi-underlying option, or an equity investment in a fund) as if the underlying positions were held directly by the bank.`


---
### Terminology for Market Risk Capital requirement Calculation

##### Risk factor: 
`A principal determinant of the change in value of an instrument (eg an exchange rate or interest rate).`

##### Risk position: 
`The portion of the current value of an instrument that may be subject to losses dueto movements in a risk factor. For example, a bond denominated in a currency different to a bank's reporting currency has risk positions in general interest rate risk, credit spread risk (non securitisation) and FX risk, where the risk positions are the potential losses to the current value of the instrument that could occur due to a change in the relevant underlying risk factors (interes rates, credit spreads, or exchange rates).`

##### Risk bucket : 
`A defined group of risk factors with similar characteristics.`

##### Risk class :
`A defined list of risks that are used as the basis for calculating market risk capital requirements: general interest rate risk, credit spread risk (non securitisation), credit spread risk securitisation: non-correlation trading portfolio), credit spread risk (securitisation: correlationtrading portfolio), EX isk, equity risk and commodity risk.`

### Terminology for Risk Metrices

##### Sensitivity: 
`A bank's estimate of the change in value of an instrument due to a small change in one of its underlying risk factors. Delta and vega rsks are sesitivitie.`

##### Delta risk: 
`The linear estimate of the change in valiue of a financial instrument due to a movementin the value of a risk factor. The risk factor could be the price of an eguity or commodity, or a change in an interest rate, credit spread or FX rate.`

##### Vega risk: 
`The potential loss resulting from the charnge in value of a derivative due to a change in the implied volatility of its underlying.`

##### Curvature risk: 
`The additional potential loss beyond delta risk due to a change in a risk factor for financial instruments with optionality. In the standardised approach in the market risk framework tis based on two stress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock to each regulatory risk factor.`

##### Value at risk VaR : 
`A measure of the worst expected loss on a portfolio of instruments resultingTrom market movements over a given time horizon and a pre-defined confidence level.`

##### Expected shortiall (ES): 
`A measure of the average of all potential losses exceeding the VaR atagiven confidence level.`

##### Jump-to-defaut UTD) : 
`The risk of a sudden default. JTD exposure refers to the loss that could beincurred rom a JTD event.`

##### Liquidity Horizon: 
`The time assumed to be required to exit or hedge a risk position withoutmaterialy affecting market prices in stressed market conditions.`

### Terminology for hedging and diversification

##### Basis risk: 
`The risk that prices of financial instruments in a hedging strategy are imperfectlycorrelated, reducing the effectiveness of the hedging strategy.`

###### Diversification: 
`The reduction in risk at a portfolio level due to holding risk positions in differentinstruments that are not perfectly correlated with one another.`

##### Hedge: 
`The process of counterbalancing risks from exposures to long and short risk positions in correlated instruments.`

##### Offset: 
`The process of netting exposures to long and short risk positions in the same risk factor.`

##### Standalone: 
`Being capitalised on a stand-alone basis means that risk positions are booked in a aiscrete, non-diversifiable trading book portfolio so that the risk associated with those risk positions cannot diversify, hedge or offset risk arising from other risk positions, nor be diversified,hedged or offset by them.`


---
### Terminology for risk factor eligibility and modellability

##### Real prices : 
`A term used for assessing whether risk factors pass the risk factor eligibility test. A price will be considered real if it is ) a price from an actual transaction conducted by the Dank ( a price from an actual transaction between other arm's length parties (eg at an exchange), or() a price taken from a firm quote e a price at which the bank could transact with an arm's length party).`

##### Modellable risk factor: 
`Risk factors that are deemed modellable, based on the number of epresentative real price observations and additional qualitative principles related to t used for the calibration of the ES model. Risk factors that do not meet the requirements for the risk factor eligibility test are dee10.27ed as non-modellable risk factors (NMRF).`


---
### Terminology for internal model validation

##### Backtesting: 
`The process of comparing daily actual and hypothetical proffts and losses withmodel-generated VaR measures to assess the conservatism of risk measurement systems.`

##### Profit and loss (P&L) attribution (PLA): 
`A method for assessing the robustness of banks riskmanagement models by comparing the risk-theoretical PBL predicted by trading desk risk management models with the hypothetical P&L.`

##### Trading desk risk management model: 
`The trading desk risk management model (pertaining to in-scope desks) includes all risk factors that are included in the bank's ES model with supervisoryparameters and any risk factors deemed not modellable, which are therefore not inctuded inES model for calculating the respective regulatory capital requirement, but are included inNMRFS.`

##### Acual P&L (APL): 
`The actual P&L derived from the daily P&L process. It indludes intraday tradingas wel as time effects and new and modified deals, but excludes fees and commission5 as wel a5 valuation adjustments for which separate regulatory capital approaches have been otherwise specified as part of the rules or which are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1. Any other valuation adjustments that are market risk-related must be included in the APL As is the case for the hypothetical P8L, the APL should include FX and commodity risks from positions held in the banking book.`

##### Hypothetical P&L (HPL): 
`The daily P&L produced by revaluing the positions held at the end of theprevious day using the market data at the end of the current day. Commissions, fees, intraday trading and new/modified deals, valuation adjustments for which separate regulatory capital approaches have been otherwise specified as part of the rules and valuation adjustments which are deducted from CET1 are excluded from the HPL Valuation adjustments updated daily should uSually be included in the HPL Time effects should be treated in a consistent manner in the HPL and risk-theoretical P&L.`

##### Risk-theoretical P&L (RTPL): 
`The daily desk-level P&L that is predicted by the valuation enginesin the trading desk risk management model using all risk factors used in the trading desk risk management model (ie including the NMRFS).`

### Terminology for credit valuation adjustment risk

##### Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): 
`An adjustment to the valuation of a derivative transaction to account for the credit risk of contracting parties.`

##### CVA risk : 
`The risk of changes to CVA arising from changes in credit spreads of the contracting parties, compounded by changes to the value or variability in the value of the underlying of the derivative transaction.`
